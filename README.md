## Download

* Downloads are hosted on
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/aviaryan/learnxinyminutes-pdf/releases/tag/v2016.08.27)
* [learnxinyminutes.pdf](https://github.com/aviaryan/learnxinyminutes-pdf/releases/download/v2016.08.27/learnxinyminutes.pdf) is the all-in-one PDF.
* The individual PDF files can be found as
[release attachments](https://github.com/aviaryan/learnxinyminutes-pdf/releases/tag/v2016.08.27).
* If you want a zip of all individual PDF's, then download
[learnxinyminutes_all.zip](https://github.com/aviaryan/learnxinyminutes-pdf/releases/download/v2016.08.27/learnxinyminutes_all.zip).

### Limitations

* `learnxinyminutes.pdf` doesn't include 2 languages; latex and markdown. This
is because they caused conflicts while building the pdf (you can guess why). If
needed, you can always download their individual pdf's from the
[release attachments](https://github.com/aviaryan/learnxinyminutes-pdf/releases/tag/v2016.08.27).

### Build Requirements

* Python 3
* Pandoc
* Latex

### Build Instructions

1. Run `genpdf.py`. It generates the all-in-one pdf and the parsed markdown
files.
2. Run `_genpdf.sh`. It generates the individual pdf-s. Note that this takes
the generated files from Python script (in _temp directory) as the input.
3. To update on GitHub, first create a new release from the web UI. Then run
`upload-releases.py`.
